The `db.csv` is the database used to organise all taxonomical and sequences data just like these sequences, the `seq_rename.R` is a R script that allows to rename all sequences with a local database naming based on `>taxID_accession_no_coded_protein` fasta sequence name.

## Cured data
In this folder you will find all the generated data, organised in several folders for each step of the analysis and type of data used.
